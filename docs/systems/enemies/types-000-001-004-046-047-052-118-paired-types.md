## Implementation

```gdscript
# Types 0, 4 - Use Type 3 (Ammo) behavior
extends Area2D
class_name AmmoVariant
# Same as Type 3, different sprite

# Type 46 - Use mechanism pattern
extends StaticBody2D  
class_name MechanismVariant
# Interactive object pattern

# Type 47 - Use Type 48 (Platform B) behavior
extends AnimatableBody2D
class_name PlatformVariant
# Moving platform pattern

# Type 52 - Use Type 39 behavior
extends StaticBody2D
class_name MechanismVariant2
# Mechanism pattern

# Type 118 - Use Type 24 (Special Ammo) behavior
extends Area2D
class_name SpecialAmmoVariant
# Ammo pickup pattern

# Type 1 - Likely collectible
extends Area2D
class_name EarlyCollectible
# Collectible pattern
```
